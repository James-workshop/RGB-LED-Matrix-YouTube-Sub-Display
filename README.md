# RGB-LED-Matrix-YouTube-Sub-Display
Displaying live YouTube subscriber count using an LED Matrix and and ESP8266 (Arduino)

Always hope to create a unique YouTube subscriber counter
When I found the Adafruit GFX compatible graphics driver for LED matrix panels library & Arduino YouTube API written by Brian Lough, I knew I wanted my YouTube subscriber counter to look like this
Thanks to Brian Lough for the inspiration and the original sketch. https://github.com/witnessmenow
